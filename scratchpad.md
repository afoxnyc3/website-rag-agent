# Scratchpad - Planning & Notes

## 🔬 ULTRATHINK: RAG vs Direct Comparison Analysis

### Problem Statement

We need comprehensive performance comparison between RAG-based and Direct approaches to provide clear guidance on when to use each method. Currently we have three modes (Agent, RAG, Direct) but no quantitative analysis of their trade-offs.

### Objectives

1. **Benchmark Performance**: Measure response times, accuracy, token usage
2. **Create Decision Matrix**: Clear guidelines for approach selection
3. **Document Trade-offs**: Cost vs quality vs speed analysis
4. **Build Evaluation Framework**: Automated testing pipeline
5. **Provide Recommendations**: Use case mapping to optimal approach

### Architecture Design

#### 1. Evaluation Dataset Creation

```typescript
interface EvalQuery {
  id: string;
  query: string;
  category: 'factual' | 'reasoning' | 'creative' | 'retrieval';
  expectedMode: 'rag' | 'direct' | 'agent';
  groundTruth?: string;
  acceptableAnswers?: string[];
}
```

#### 2. Metrics Collection

```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  mode: string;
  responseTime: number;
  tokensUsed: number;
  estimatedCost: number;
  confidence: number;
  accuracy?: number;
  relevance?: number;
}
```

#### 3. Comparison Framework

```typescript
class RAGvsDirectAnalyzer {
  async runComparison(query: EvalQuery): Promise<ComparisonResult>;
  async runBenchmark(dataset: EvalQuery[]): Promise<BenchmarkReport>;
  async generateDecisionMatrix(): Promise<DecisionMatrix>;
}
```

### Implementation Strategy (TDD)

#### Phase 1: Create Evaluation Infrastructure

- Build EvalDataset class with test queries
- Create MetricsCollector for performance tracking
- Implement ResultAnalyzer for statistical analysis

#### Phase 2: Design Test Scenarios

- **Factual Queries**: "What is the capital of France?"
- **Retrieval Queries**: "What did the documentation say about X?"
- **Reasoning Queries**: "Why would someone choose Y over Z?"
- **Creative Queries**: "Generate a story about..."

#### Phase 3: Implement Comparison Logic

- Execute same query in both modes
- Collect comprehensive metrics
- Statistical analysis of results
- Generate comparison reports

#### Phase 4: Build Decision Matrix

- Query complexity scoring
- Knowledge base relevance detection
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Mode recommendation engine

#### Phase 5: Create Visualization & Reports

- Performance charts
- Cost analysis graphs
- Decision flow diagrams
- Markdown report generation

### Success Metrics

1. **Response Time**: RAG < 500ms, Direct < 200ms average
2. **Accuracy**: Document which mode performs better for each category
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Token usage comparison with $ estimates
4. **Decision Clarity**: 90% of queries should have clear mode recommendation
5. **Documentation**: Complete analysis report with visualizations

### Test-First Development Plan

1. Write tests for EvalDataset class
2. Write tests for MetricsCollector
3. Write tests for comparison logic
4. Write tests for decision matrix generation
5. Write tests for report generation
6. Implement each component to pass tests

### Expected Outcomes

- **Decision Matrix**: Clear guidelines when to use RAG vs Direct
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Quantitative comparison data
- **Cost Analysis**: Token usage and API cost comparison
- **Use Case Mapping**: Specific scenarios mapped to optimal approach
- **API Enhancement**: Optional mode parameter for manual override

## 2025-09-21 - Source Attribution Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED

### 🔬 ULTRATHINK: Source Attribution Fix

#### Problem Analysis

Currently, when users see source citations in responses, they only see base URLs (e.g., "docs.example.com") instead of the specific pages where content was found (e.g., "docs.example.com/api/authentication#oauth2"). This reduces trust and makes it difficult for users to verify information or explore related content.

#### Diagnostic Test Results ✅

**Phase 1 Complete**: All backend components are preserving URLs correctly!

- ScrapeTool: 23/23 tests passing (6 new URL preservation tests)
- CrawlTool: 28/29 tests passing (6 new URL preservation tests)
- RAG Service: 5/5 URL preservation tests passing

**Key Finding**: The backend is NOT the problem. Full URLs are being preserved through the entire data pipeline.

#### Solution Implemented ✅

**PR #12 Merged**: Fixed UI to show clean hostnames while preserving full URLs:

- Modified `InlineCitationCardTrigger` to extract and display hostname
- Full URLs still preserved in data for verification
- Cleaner UI with "example.com" instead of full paths in badges

**PR #13 Created**: Fixed flaky CrawlTool test that was timing out

#### Solution Architecture

##### 1. Metadata Structure Enhancement

```typescript
interface DocumentMetadata {
  url: string; // Full URL with path and hash
  baseUrl: string; // Domain for grouping
  title: string; // Page title
  excerpt: string; // Relevant text snippet
  lastScraped: Date; // Freshness tracking
  depth?: number; // For crawled pages
}
```

##### 2. URL Preservation Pipeline

- ScrapeTool: Ensure full URL is passed to metadata
- CrawlTool: Preserve individual page URLs for each scraped page
- RAGService: Maintain URL integrity during chunking
- Storage: Verify both memory and persistent storage preserve URLs

##### 3. Source Display Enhancement

- Show full URL path in citations
- Add page title alongside URL
- Include relevant excerpt on hover
- Display freshness indicator (how old the source is)

#### Implementation Strategy (TDD)

##### Phase 1: Diagnostic Tests

- Write tests to verify current URL preservation at each stage
- Test ScrapeTool metadata storage
- Test CrawlTool page URL tracking
- Test RAG service document metadata preservation
- Test storage strategies URL handling

##### Phase 2: Fix URL Preservation

- Update ScrapeTool to always store full URL
- Update CrawlTool to maintain page-level URLs
- Ensure RAG service preserves metadata during chunking
- Verify storage strategies maintain URL integrity

##### Phase 3: Enhance Metadata

- Add page title extraction to scraping tools
- Implement excerpt extraction (relevant snippet)
- Add timestamp tracking for freshness
- Store crawl depth for context

##### Phase 4: UI Improvements

- Update source display component to show full paths
- Add hover previews with excerpts
- Implement freshness indicators
- Add "View Source" links that open in new tabs

#### Test Scenarios

1. **Single Page Scrape**: Verify full URL is preserved
2. **Multi-Page Crawl**: Each page should have its own URL
3. **Chunked Documents**: All chunks should reference original URL
4. **Search Results**: Retrieved documents should have complete URLs
5. **UI Display**: Sources should show full paths and titles

#### Success Metrics

- 100% of sources display full URL paths
- Page titles visible for all sources
- Excerpt previews available on hover
- Freshness indicators show age of sources
- Users can click through to exact source pages

### Problem Analysis

Current confidence scoring is too simplistic - only uses vector similarity. Users need:

- Multi-factor confidence calculation
- Clear visual indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Explanations for confidence levels
- Better handling of low-confidence responses

### Solution Design

#### Multi-Factor Confidence Formula

```
confidence = (
  similarityScore * 0.4 +    // Vector similarity weight
  sourceCountScore * 0.2 +    // Number of sources weight
  recencyScore * 0.2 +        // How recent sources are
  diversityScore * 0.2        // Source diversity weight
)
```

#### Confidence Levels

- **High** (0.7-1.0): ✅ Green - "I'm confident in this answer"
- **Medium** (0.4-0.69): ⚠️ Yellow - "I found some relevant information"
- **Low** (0.0-0.39): ❌ Red - "I don't have enough information"

#### Implementation Plan (TDD)

1. Create ConfidenceCalculator class with tests
2. Implement multi-factor calculation
3. Add confidence explanations
4. Integrate with RAG service
5. Update UI with visual indicators
6. Add calibration tests

### Test-First Development

- Write comprehensive tests for each factor
- Test edge cases (no sources, old sources, etc.)
- Test threshold boundaries
- Test explanation generation
- Test UI component rendering

## 2025-09-21 - Playwright Installation Fix ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem Solved

**Issue**: New users experienced crashes when scraping due to missing Playwright browser binaries
**Solution**: Added postinstall script and updated documentation
**Status**: ✅ MERGED to main branch

### Changes Made

1. Added `postinstall` script to package.json: `"postinstall": "npx playwright install"`
2. Updated README.md Prerequisites to mention automatic browser installation
3. Added comment in Quick Start that browsers install automatically
4. Updated Tech Stack section to clarify browsers are auto-installed

### Test Results

- Postinstall script runs successfully on `pnpm install`
- Playwright v1.55.0 confirmed working
- No more manual `npx playwright install` needed

---

## 2025-09-21 - Source Attribution Fix ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem Solved

**Issue**: Sources were showing only hostnames (e.g., "example.com") instead of full URLs
**Solution**: Fixed UI component and BaseAgent tool selection
**Status**: PR #8 merged

### Root Causes Fixed

1. `InlineCitationCardTrigger` was extracting hostname with `new URL(sources[0]).hostname`
2. BaseAgent `selectTool()` was returning wrong tool names

### Test Results

- All 15 new URL preservation tests passing
- API verification successful
- Manual testing confirms full URLs displayed
