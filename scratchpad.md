# Scratchpad - Planning & Notes

## 2025-09-21 - Enhance Confidence Scoring üöÄ IN PROGRESS

### Problem Analysis

Current confidence scoring is too simplistic - only uses vector similarity. Users need:

- Multi-factor confidence calculation
- Clear visual indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Explanations for confidence levels
- Better handling of low-confidence responses

### Solution Design

#### Multi-Factor Confidence Formula

```
confidence = (
  similarityScore * 0.4 +    // Vector similarity weight
  sourceCountScore * 0.2 +    // Number of sources weight
  recencyScore * 0.2 +        // How recent sources are
  diversityScore * 0.2        // Source diversity weight
)
```

#### Confidence Levels

- **High** (0.7-1.0): ‚úÖ Green - "I'm confident in this answer"
- **Medium** (0.4-0.69): ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow - "I found some relevant information"
- **Low** (0.0-0.39): ‚ùå Red - "I don't have enough information"

#### Implementation Plan (TDD)

1. Create ConfidenceCalculator class with tests
2. Implement multi-factor calculation
3. Add confidence explanations
4. Integrate with RAG service
5. Update UI with visual indicators
6. Add calibration tests

### Test-First Development

- Write comprehensive tests for each factor
- Test edge cases (no sources, old sources, etc.)
- Test threshold boundaries
- Test explanation generation
- Test UI component rendering

## 2025-09-21 - Playwright Installation Fix ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Problem Solved

**Issue**: New users experienced crashes when scraping due to missing Playwright browser binaries
**Solution**: Added postinstall script and updated documentation
**Status**: ‚úÖ MERGED to main branch

### Changes Made

1. Added `postinstall` script to package.json: `"postinstall": "npx playwright install"`
2. Updated README.md Prerequisites to mention automatic browser installation
3. Added comment in Quick Start that browsers install automatically
4. Updated Tech Stack section to clarify browsers are auto-installed

### Test Results

- Postinstall script runs successfully on `pnpm install`
- Playwright v1.55.0 confirmed working
- No more manual `npx playwright install` needed

## 2025-09-21 - Source Attribution Fix ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Problem Solved

**Issue**: Sources were showing only hostnames (e.g., "example.com") instead of full URLs
**Solution**: Fixed UI component and BaseAgent tool selection
**Status**: PR #8 merged

### Root Causes Fixed

1. `InlineCitationCardTrigger` was extracting hostname with `new URL(sources[0]).hostname`
2. BaseAgent `selectTool()` was returning wrong tool names

### Test Results

- All 15 new URL preservation tests passing
- API verification successful
- Manual testing confirms full URLs displayed

## Next Focus Areas (from roadmap.md)

### 1. Enhance Confidence Scoring (HIGH PRIORITY)

- Implement multi-factor calculation
- Add visual indicators in UI
- Create calibration tests

### 2. Documentation Cleanup (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- Resolve discrepancies between claude.md and agents.md
- Standardize output format documentation

### 3. Implement Evals Framework (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- Design evaluation pipeline
- Create initial test dataset
- Implement basic metrics
