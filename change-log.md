  - Implemented `BaseAgent` constructor with proper initialization
  - All properties stored with appropriate defaults (confidenceThreshold = 0.5)
  - Following strict TDD: 9 tests written before implementation
  - Tests passing 100% for Phase 1: Agent Configuration

### Phase 2: Intent Recognition âœ…

  - Preserves all metadata fields (url, title, timestamps, etc.)
  - Chunks large content (>3000 chars) for embedding constraints
  - Handles failed results gracefully with error metadata
- **ProcessedContent Interface**: Structured output format
  - content: Full extracted text
  - chunks: Optional array for large documents
  - metadata: Complete field preservation
