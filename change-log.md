# Change Log

## 2025-09-19 - Agent Orchestration Layer (TDD Implementation)

### Phase 1: Agent Configuration ✅
- **BaseAgent Class**: Foundation for intelligent agent system
  - Created `AgentConfig` interface with name, description, toolRegistry, ragService, confidenceThreshold
  - Implemented `BaseAgent` constructor with proper initialization
  - All properties stored with appropriate defaults (confidenceThreshold = 0.5)
  - Following strict TDD: 9 tests written before implementation
  - Tests passing 100% for Phase 1: Agent Configuration

### Phase 2: Intent Recognition ✅
- **parseIntent Method**: Query understanding and classification
  - Added `IntentType` enum: 'url' | 'question' | 'command' | 'unknown'
  - Created `ParsedIntent` interface with type, query, urls, keywords
  - Implemented cascading pattern matching (URLs → Questions → Commands)
  - URL detection using regex for http://, https://, www.
  - Question detection for what/who/where/when/why/how queries
  - Command detection with keyword extraction
  - 3 new tests, 12/12 total tests passing

### Phase 3: Decision Logic ✅
- **shouldFetchNewData Method**: Smart caching and fetch decisions
  - Only fetches for URL intents, not questions/commands
  - Implements 5-minute cache TTL to prevent redundant fetches
  - Cache check prevents unnecessary API calls
  - Returns boolean for fetch decision
- **selectTool Method**: Intelligent tool selection
  - ScrapeTool for specific pages (URLs with paths)
  - CrawlTool for entire sites or crawl keywords
  - Returns null for non-URL intents
  - URL parsing with error handling
- **Testing**: 6 new tests, 18/18 total passing

### Phase 4: Tool Execution ✅
- **executeTool Method**: Actual tool execution with error handling
  - Gets tool from registry and executes with input
  - Three-layer error handling (no registry, tool not found, execution error)
  - Timeout protection using Promise.race
  - Automatic cache update on successful URL fetches
  - Returns ToolResult with success/error status
- **ToolExecutionOptions Interface**: Configurable execution
  - Optional timeout parameter for execution control
  - Clean timeout implementation with error message
- **Testing**: 4 new tests covering success, failure, and timeout
- **Total Tests**: 22/22 passing (100% coverage)

### Technical Decisions
- Using TDD approach with granular atomic tests for reliability
- Mocking RAGService in tests to avoid OpenAI API dependency
- BaseAgent designed as extensible foundation for RAGAgent specialization
- Pattern matching over AI for intent detection (faster, free, predictable)

## 2025-09-18 - Bug Fix: VectorStore Document Format

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug in MemoryStorage**: Resolved document format mismatch

- **Storage Method Corrections**:
  - Updated `search()` to use VectorStore's actual API methods
  - Implemented workaround for `deleteDocument()` (VectorStore lacks delete method)
