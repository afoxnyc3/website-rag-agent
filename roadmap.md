# BaseAgent - Development Roadmap

## üéØ High Priority

### RAG vs Direct Comparison Analysis

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-09-21)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)

#### Description

Complete and document comprehensive performance comparison between RAG-based and Direct approaches to provide clear guidance on when to use each method.

#### Success Criteria

- [x] Benchmark response times for both approaches
- [x] Measure accuracy and relevance scores
- [x] Document token usage and costs
- [x] Create decision matrix for approach selection
- [x] Provide clear use case recommendations

#### Implementation Notes

- Create evaluation dataset with diverse query types
- Measure metrics: latency, accuracy, cost, confidence
- Document in `/docs/rag-vs-direct-analysis.md`
- Update API to expose mode selection

### Confidence Scoring System Enhancement

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-09-21)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: Small (1 day)

#### Description

Improve confidence score calculation and display to provide users with better transparency about response reliability.

#### Current State

- Multi-factor confidence scoring fully implemented
- Three clear confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Human-readable explanations in responses

#### Success Criteria

- [x] Implement multi-factor confidence calculation
- [x] Define clear confidence thresholds (low/medium/high)
- [x] Add confidence explanations in responses
- [x] Handle low-confidence responses appropriately
- [x] Create confidence calibration tests

#### Implementation Notes

- Consider factors: similarity score, source count, recency
- Add confidence breakdown in API response
- Update UI to show confidence visually (color coding)

### Source Attribution Enhancement

**Status**: üîç Under Investigation - Debug Logging Added
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: Small (1 day)

#### Description

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] Sources link to exact pages scraped
- [ ] Preserve full URL in document metadata
- [ ] Display page title with source
- [ ] Show relevant excerpt from source
- [ ] Track source freshness (last updated)

#### Implementation Notes

- Modify document metadata structure
- Fix source display in chat responses
- Add source preview on hover

---

### Web Crawling Depth Issues

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-09-21)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: Medium (2 days)

#### Description

Debug and fix crawling limitation where crawler stops after only a couple of pages despite higher depth settings.

#### Current Issues

- Crawler stops prematurely (2-3 pages max)
- Depth parameter not being respected
- May be related to URL filtering or queue management

#### Success Criteria

- [x] Crawl full sites as configured
- [x] Respect maxDepth parameter accurately
- [x] Process maxPages as specified
- [x] Fix URL queue management
- [x] Add progress tracking for large crawls

#### Implementation Notes

- Debug CrawlTool queue processing
- Check URL normalization issues
- Verify robots.txt isn't over-blocking
- Add detailed crawl logging
- Consider implementing resume capability

#### Description

Set up comprehensive evaluation pipeline for agent responses to ensure quality and catch regressions.

#### Components

- [ ] Create evaluation dataset
- [ ] Define success metrics
- [ ] Build automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Create regression test suite
- [ ] Set up continuous evaluation

#### Success Metrics
