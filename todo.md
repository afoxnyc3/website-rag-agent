## ðŸš§ Current Development: Agent Orchestration Layer

**Note:** Per user request, breaking down Agent implementation into granular TDD tasks to increase probability of success.

### Phase 1: Agent Configuration (Tests â†’ Implementation)
- [ ] Test: AgentConfig interface accepts name property
- [ ] Test: AgentConfig interface accepts description property
- [ ] Test: AgentConfig interface accepts toolRegistry property
- [ ] Test: AgentConfig interface accepts ragService property
- [ ] Test: AgentConfig interface accepts confidenceThreshold property
- [ ] Implement: Create AgentConfig interface
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent constructor accepts AgentConfig
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent stores name from config
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent stores description from config
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent defaults confidenceThreshold to 0.5
- [ ] Implement: Create BaseAgent constructor

### Phase 2: Intent Recognition
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.parseIntent identifies URL in query
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.parseIntent identifies question in query
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.parseIntent identifies command in query
- [ ] Implement: Create parseIntent method

### Phase 3: Decision Logic
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.shouldFetchNewData returns true for URLs
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.shouldFetchNewData returns false for questions
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.shouldFetchNewData checks cache expiry
- [ ] Implement: Create shouldFetchNewData method
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.selectTool returns ScrapeTool for single URL
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.selectTool returns CrawlTool for site URL
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.selectTool returns null for non-URL
- [ ] Implement: Create selectTool method

### Phase 4: Tool Execution
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.executeTool calls tool.execute
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.executeTool handles tool success
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.executeTool handles tool failure
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.executeTool adds timeout wrapper
- [ ] Implement: Create executeTool method

### Phase 5: Data Processing
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.processToolResult extracts content
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.processToolResult chunks large content
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.processToolResult preserves metadata
- [ ] Implement: Create processToolResult method
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.ingestToRAG calls addDocument
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.ingestToRAG generates embeddings
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.ingestToRAG handles batch documents
- [ ] Implement: Create ingestToRAG method

### Phase 6: Knowledge Operations
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.searchKnowledge queries RAG service
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.searchKnowledge returns confidence score
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.searchKnowledge includes sources
- [ ] Implement: Create searchKnowledge method
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.validateResponse checks confidence
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.validateResponse checks relevance
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.validateResponse checks sources exist
- [ ] Implement: Create validateResponse method

### Phase 7: Orchestration
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.execute orchestrates full pipeline
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.execute handles fetch-and-respond flow
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.execute handles query-only flow
- [ ] Test: BaseAgent.execute handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Implement: Create execute orchestration method

### Phase 8: RAG Agent Specialization
- [ ] Test: RAGAgent extends BaseAgent
- [ ] Test: RAGAgent auto-ingests scraped content
- [ ] Test: RAGAgent maintains conversation context
- [ ] Implement: Create RAGAgent class

### Phase 9: Integration Tests
- [ ] Test: Integration - URL to knowledge to answer
- [ ] Test: Integration - Multiple URLs batch processing
- [ ] Test: Integration - Cache prevents redundant fetches
- [ ] Run: Full test suite passes 100%

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
