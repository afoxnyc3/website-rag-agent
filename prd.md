# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Summary
Create an intelligent knowledge assistant that automatically ingests website content and provides instant, contextual answers to user questions. This eliminates the need for manual content searching and ensures precise information retrieval.

## Phased Development Plan

### **MVP: Basic Text-Only RAG**
- Simple Q&A agent with pre-loaded text content
- OpenAI embeddings + chat completion
- In-memory vector storage
- Basic query/response interface

### **Phase 0: Tool Chest Foundation**
- Vercel AI SDK integration
- Base agent class with tool calling
- Embedding generation service
- Simple vector similarity search
- Response formatting utilities

### **Phase 1: Web Scraping**
- Single page content extraction using Playwright
- Clean text extraction from URLs
- Handle different content types (articles, docs)
- Store scraped content for embedding

### **Phase 2: Web Crawling**
- Multi-page site crawling using Crawl4AI
- Intelligent site navigation and discovery
- Respect robots.txt and rate limiting
- Batch processing of discovered pages

### **Phase 3: Persistent Storage**
- Vercel Postgres + pgvector for vector storage
- Persistent embedding storage and retrieval
- Content deduplication and updates
- Search optimization and indexing

## Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: >95% correct responses when confidence â‰¥ 0.9
- **Performance**: <200ms average query response time
- **User Experience**: Clear confidence scoring and source attribution
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime in production
